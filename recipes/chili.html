    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My father and I created this easy 5-ingredient chili recipe and everyone we have made it for loved it. It is
        fast, simple, and delicious.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>15 ounces tomato sauce</li>
        <li> 1 can kidney beans, drained</li>
        <li>1 can chili beans, not drained</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chili powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and
            crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.

        </li>
        <li>Stir in kidney beans, chili beans, and tomato sauce. Bring to a boil and stir in chili powder. Reduce heat
            to a simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 15 minutes. Season to taste with salt
            and pepper.</li>
    </ol>
